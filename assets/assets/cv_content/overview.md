Hi, I'm Greg van Berkel. I am a software engineer who loves to work with others to build valuable fit-for-purpose software. I founded and head up a software company that helps entrepreneurs build the technology they need to succeed. I crave technical deep dives with a particular joy for creating front end tooling and code patterns that help developers deliver great applications. I like to geek in collaboration.
