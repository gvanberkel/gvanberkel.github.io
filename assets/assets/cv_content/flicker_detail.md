The main focus areas are:  

- Simple routing and menu system (based on Navigator 2.0)  
- Application state (via Riverpod), permissions, page lifecycle (init, deactivate methods) abstractions at page level. 
- Screen validation patterns.
- User authentication hooks.
- Loading, invalid route, error screen widget hooks (with defaults if not implemented).
- Responsive screen layouts patterns (with some flicker user controls where existing ones couldn't be found) for common screen patterns (search grids, list screens, form screens).
