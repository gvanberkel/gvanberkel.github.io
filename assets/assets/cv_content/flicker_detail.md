The main focus areas are:  

- Simple routing and menu system (based on Navigator 2.0)  
- Page level application state (via Riverpod), permissions and lifecycle abstractions. 
- Validation patterns.
- User authentication hooks.
- Loading, invalid route, error screen widget hooks (with defaults if not implemented).
- Common responsive screen layout patterns (with some flicker user controls where existing ones couldn't be found).
