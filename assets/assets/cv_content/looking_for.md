# What I'm looking for

I'm interested in working on tooling to help developers or working directly with developer teams to skill up and remove impediments. In an alternative reality to perhaps work on a new product that I believe in.

Some roles I think I'd be a good fit for:
- Technical dev manager.
- Technical product owner.
- Software engineer.
