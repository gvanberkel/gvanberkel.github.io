# What I'm looking for

Either working on tooling or libraries or frameworks to help developers, also potentially working directly with developer teams to skill up and remove impediments or in an alternative reality to perhaps work on a new product that I really believe in.

Some roles I think I'd be a good fit for:
- Technical dev manager (there must be coding).
- Software engineer.
- Technical product owner (there must be coding).

Above all I'm keen to work on something that I believe in and believe I can contribute constructively towards.
