# What I'm looking for

I'm interested in working on tooling, libraries or frameworks to help developers, also working directly with developer teams to skill up and remove impediments or in an alternative reality to perhaps work on a new product that I believe in.

Some roles I think I'd be a good fit for:
- Technical dev manager.
- Technical product owner.
- Software engineer.

I'm keen to work on something that I believe in and believe I can contribute constructively towards.
