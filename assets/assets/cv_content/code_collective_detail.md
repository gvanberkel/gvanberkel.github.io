These are some highlights of my [Code Collective](https://codecollective.com) journey.
  
- Keeping a software company profitable and interesting enough to thrive for 15 years.
- Creating a brand and company culture that software developers relate to.
- Developing a recruitment process that helps finding people that are a good fit.
- Implementing a mentoring program that helps developers understand their impediments, interests and strengths.
- Implementing a capability development program to support aligned skills improvements.
- Establishing value based (not only rate based) contracts with clients.
- At its peak Code Collective had 15 developers, testers and product owners.
