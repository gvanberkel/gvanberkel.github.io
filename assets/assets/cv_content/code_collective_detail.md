These are some highlights of my Code Collective journey.
  
- Keeping a software company alive and profitable and interesting enough to thrive for 15 years.
- Creating a brand that software developers relate to.
- Developing and evolving a recruitment process that helps Code Collective find people that are a good fit.
- Nurturing foundational principles that allow for emotional safety, autonomy and good performance.
- Implementing a mentoring program that helps developers understand their impediments, interests and strengths.
- Implementing a capability development program to support continuous skills improvements that are aligned to developer and business goals.
- Establishing value based (not only rate based) contracts necessitating a value based learning journey for Code Collective and their customers.
- At its peak Code Collective had 15 developers, testers and product owners.
