You may have noticed (if you are that way inclined) that this is a pretty inefficient content-providing web page. That's because it is built using Flutter (an application UI toolkit more than a content providing framework). Flutter is selfishly where my frontend technology interest currently lies and I hope it is not taken as a reflection of my ability to choose appropriate technologies for the task at hand (something I expressly state here that I have some ability to do!).  

The content you are reading is stored in markdown files and converted to what you are reading using a Flutter package called flutter_markdown. In future I could create a more 'fit for purpose' version of this page using the same markdown.
