# TruckFuelNet

*What is TruckFuelNet?:* ***Technology enabled diesel retail broker***  

[TruckFuelNet](https://www.tfn.co.za) is Renati's largest product and it is worth a separate mention as I have been resonsible for technology development on the TFN platform since 2007 and continue to own the technology delivery for the platform. Renati bought the IP for their TruckFuelNet technology from Code Collective in 2019. Myself and a number of Code Collective staff moved over to Renati at the time (me on a part time basis and the others on a full time basis).

TruckFuelNet is a broker business that connects fuel stations with fleet owners via a software platform. The software platform in 2007 was initially built solely by myself and it was also Code Collective's first project. In 2021 TFN has a a team of 10 developers that enable their software endevours and they sell over **25 million litres of fuel per month**.
