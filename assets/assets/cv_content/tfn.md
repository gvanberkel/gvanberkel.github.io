# TruckFuelNet

*What is TruckFuelNet?:* ***Technology enabled diesel retail broker***  

[TruckFuelNet](https://www.tfn.co.za) is Renati's most successful product and it is worth a separate mention as I have been responsible for technology development at TFN since 2007 and continue to own technology delivery. 

Renati bought the IP for their TruckFuelNet technology from Code Collective in 2019. Myself and a number of Code Collective staff moved over to Renati at the time (me on a part time basis and the others on a full time basis).

The software platform in 2007 was initially built solely by myself and it was also Code Collective's first project. In 2021 TFN has a team of 10 developers that enable their software endeavours and they sell over 25 million litres of fuel per month.
