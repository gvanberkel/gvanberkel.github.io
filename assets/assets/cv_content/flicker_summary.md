# Flicker 

*What is Flicker?:* ***Application development patterns for boring Flutter applications***  

Flicker's goal is to expose some patterns that make enterprise style app development easy. I think [Flicker](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_flicker) is an anti pattern package in that it is designed to abstract away a lot of Flutter's beautiful implementation-agnostic flexiblity.
