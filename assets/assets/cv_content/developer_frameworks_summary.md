# Developer Frameworks

I really enjoy moving from an implementation agnostic technology, like .NET or Flutter to a set of defined (and potentially enforced) coding patterns that support the goals of a specific feature or product and help developers move quickly and consistently. I also like working with developer teams to successfully define and adopt these patterns.
