*What is slickjs?:* ***Web front end framework***  

Slickjs is a Single Page App framework built with some front end technologies from the 2011 era (Knockoutjs, JQueryMobile...). It allows developers to support both legacy devices and modern web browsers with a single codebase. The modern experience included visual animations, offline support and good use of a larger screen size.
