*What is slickjs?:* ***Web front end framework***  

Slickjs is a Single Page App framework built with some front end technologies from the 2011 era (Knockoutjs, JQueryMobile...) that allow developers to code once and support both legacy devices and modern web browsers where the modern experience included visual animations, offline support and good use of a larger screen size.
