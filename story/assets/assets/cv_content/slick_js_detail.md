In late 2011 when we started to imagine a front end framework for Guidepost. We had to build something that would work on a wide spectrum of devices (everything from Nokia Symbian devices and Blackberries to modern web browsers running on a desktop) and we wanted it to have the potential to work offline when the targeted platform supported it.

The framework was built at a time when front end technologies were moving fast and thus it only has 3 large scale projects that use it. All of which have similar non functional requirements.

Slickjs was imagined collaboratively with the Guidepost team and mostly architected and developed by myself over a period of 6 months.
