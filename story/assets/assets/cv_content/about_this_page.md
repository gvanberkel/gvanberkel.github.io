You may have noticed (if you are that way inclined) that this is a very inefficient content providing web page (and it's not even a WordPress site). That's because it is built using Flutter (an application framework more than a content providing framework). You could call this url an experiment in providing simple content using the Flutter framework but it is selfishly just where my frontend technology interest currently lies and I hope it is not taken as a reflection of my ability to choose appropriate technologies for the task at hand (something I expressly state here that I have some ability to do!).  

The content you are reading is stored in markdown files and converted to what you are reading using a Flutter package called flutter_markdown. So in future I could redeem myself and create more 'fit for perpose' versions of this using the same markdown if the occasion presented itself.
